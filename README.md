# REST API With Node, Express, TypeScript & MongoDB

## Description

This project is a RESTful API built using Node, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle HTTP requests and interact with a MongoDB database.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project were:

- Create a robust and scalable API using modern technologies.
- Implement TypeScript for improved code maintainability and type safety.
- Utilize MongoDB as the database for data storage and retrieval.
- Develop a set of controllers and middlewares to handle authentication and user-related operations.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- Setting up a Node.js environment with TypeScript for a backend application.
- Integrating and interacting with a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- Implementing authentication mechanisms for user management.
- Organizing the codebase using controllers, middlewares, and routes for better maintainability.

## Tools Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building robust and scalable APIs.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features for better code quality.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data in a flexible and efficient manner.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB, providing a straightforward way to interact with the database.
- **Nodemon**: A utility that monitors for changes in files and automatically restarts the server.
- **Body-parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
- **Compression**: Middleware for compressing responses to reduce response times.
- **Cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies attached to the client's request.
- **Cors**: Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Lodash**: A utility library providing useful functions for working with arrays, objects, and more.
